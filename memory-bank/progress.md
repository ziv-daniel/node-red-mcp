### 3. MCP Tools Implementation
- **20+ Operational Tools**: All core Node-RED operations exposed as MCP tools
- **Input Validation**: Zod-based schema validation for all tool parameters
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with detailed messages
- **Result Formatting**: Standardized tool result structure

### 4. Express Server Foundation
- **HTTP Transport**: Working Express server with middleware chain
- **Security Middleware**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting configured
- **Authentication Foundation**: JWT and API key infrastructure
- **Request Processing**: Body parsing, validation, error handling

### 5. Development Environment
- **TypeScript Setup**: Full type safety with strict configuration
- **Build System**: Working tsc compilation with hot reload
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier configured and enforcing standards
- **Testing Framework**: Jest configured (tests need completion)

## Recent Updates (June 12, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Node-RED Response Validation Improvements
- **Enhanced API Client**: Added response validation to detect HTML vs JSON responses
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages for JSON parse errors caused by HTML responses  
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Added retry mechanism for HTML responses on API endpoints
- **Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging for Node-RED API requests and responses
- **Issue Resolution**: Addressed transient "Unexpected token 'N', 'Node-RED A'..." JSON parse errors

### Known Issues Addressed
- **HTML Response Detection**: Now properly detects when Node-RED returns HTML instead of JSON
- **Graceful Recovery**: System automatically retries and provides helpful error messages
- **Root Cause**: Issue was Node-RED occasionally returning admin UI HTML on first API request

## What's In Progress üîÑ

### 1. Server-Sent Events (SSE) System (~70% Complete)
- **‚úÖ SSE Handler Core**: Connection management infrastructure
- **‚úÖ Event Types**: Defined event schema and types
- **‚úÖ Connection Tracking**: Active connection monitoring
- **üîÑ Event Filtering**: Subscription-based event delivery
- **üîÑ Health Monitoring**: Connection heartbeat and cleanup
- **‚è≥ Node-RED Integration**: Live event capture from Node-RED

### 2. Security Layer (~85% Complete)
- **‚úÖ Authentication Strategies**: JWT and API key foundation
- **‚úÖ Middleware Setup**: Express authentication middleware
- **‚úÖ Claude Integration**: Flexible authentication for Claude.ai compatibility
- **üîÑ Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **‚è≥ Security Hardening**: Complete security audit and fixes

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery (~50% Complete)
- **‚úÖ Basic Error Handling**: Error classes and response formatting
- **üîÑ Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for Node-RED API calls
- **‚è≥ Connection Recovery**: Robust reconnection for SSE and Node-RED
- **‚è≥ Graceful Degradation**: Partial functionality during failures

## What's Left to Build ‚è≥

### 1. Production Features
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with request correlation
- **Health Endpoints**: Detailed health checks with dependency status
- **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics collection and reporting
- **Configuration Validation**: Runtime configuration verification

### 2. Docker & Deployment
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with optimization
- **Docker Compose**: Complete development/production setups
- **Environment Configs**: Production-ready environment templates
- **Deployment Scripts**: Automated deployment procedures

### 3. Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: Service layer and utility function tests
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end MCP workflow testing
- **SSE Tests**: Real-time event streaming validation
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing and benchmark validation

### 4. Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Complete MCP tools and resources documentation
- **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step production deployment
- **Usage Examples**: Common integration patterns and use cases
- **Architecture Guide**: Detailed system design documentation

### 5. Advanced Features (Future)
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Redis-backed SSE for scaling
- **Enhanced Authentication**: OAuth2, SAML integration
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring interface
- **Plugin System**: Extensible functionality framework

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
1. **SSE Connection Limits**: No horizontal scaling support (single process)
2. **In-Memory State**: No persistence for connection or event state
3. **Basic Retry Logic**: Simple retry without exponential backoff
4. **Limited Test Coverage**: Core functionality tests missing
5. **Basic Error Recovery**: Need more sophisticated failure handling

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: SSE connections and event buffering impact
- **Connection Scaling**: Current limit ~100 concurrent SSE connections
- **Node-RED Polling**: Some operations require polling vs real-time events
- **Type Safety Overhead**: Compilation time increases with project size
