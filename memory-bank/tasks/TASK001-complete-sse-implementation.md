# [TASK001] - Complete SSE Implementation

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** June 12, 2025  
**Updated:** June 12, 2025

## Original Request
Complete the Server-Sent Events (SSE) system to provide real-time Node-RED monitoring and event streaming capabilities. The SSE infrastructure is ~70% complete with core connection management working, but needs completion of event filtering, health monitoring, and Node-RED event integration.

## Thought Process
The SSE implementation serves as the real-time bridge between Node-RED events and connected clients (like Claude.ai or other monitoring systems). The current implementation has solid foundations but lacks:

1. **Advanced Event Filtering**: Clients need subscription-based event delivery to receive only relevant events
2. **Health Monitoring**: Robust connection heartbeat and cleanup mechanisms for production reliability  
3. **Node-RED Event Integration**: Live capture and forwarding of Node-RED runtime events

These missing pieces are critical for production deployment and real-time monitoring effectiveness.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Event Filtering & Subscriptions
- [ ] 1.1: Implement subscription management for event types
- [ ] 1.2: Add granular filtering by flow ID, node type, etc.
- [ ] 1.3: Create subscription endpoints for dynamic filter management
- [ ] 1.4: Add event type validation and filtering logic

### Phase 2: Health Monitoring & Connection Management
- [ ] 2.1: Implement robust heartbeat system with configurable intervals
- [ ] 2.2: Add connection health checks and automatic cleanup
- [ ] 2.3: Implement connection recovery and reconnection logic
- [ ] 2.4: Add monitoring endpoints for connection statistics

### Phase 3: Node-RED Event Integration
- [ ] 3.1: Create Node-RED event listener service
- [ ] 3.2: Implement event parsing and transformation
- [ ] 3.3: Add real-time flow status monitoring
- [ ] 3.4: Integrate runtime events (deploy, start, stop, error)

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 70% Complete

## Progress Log
### 2025-06-12
- **Task Created**: Identified remaining 30% of SSE implementation work
- **Current State**: Core SSE handler with connection management is working
- **Next Priority**: Begin with event filtering and subscription management
- **Dependencies**: None - can proceed with current codebase
