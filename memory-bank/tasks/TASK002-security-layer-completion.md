# [TASK002] - Security Layer Completion

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** June 12, 2025  
**Updated:** June 12, 2025

## Original Request
Complete the security layer implementation to achieve production-ready authentication and authorization. The security foundation is ~85% complete with JWT/API key authentication working, but needs completion of role-based access control and comprehensive security hardening.

## Thought Process
The current security implementation provides basic authentication but lacks the granular authorization and security hardening needed for production deployment. Missing components include:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different user roles should have different Node-RED permissions
2. **Security Hardening**: Comprehensive security audit, secure defaults, and protection mechanisms
3. **Enhanced Authentication**: Additional auth methods, session management, and security validation

These components are essential for enterprise deployment and multi-user scenarios.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] 1.1: Define permission system for Node-RED operations
- [ ] 1.2: Implement role definitions (admin, user, readonly, etc.)
- [ ] 1.3: Add permission checking middleware for MCP tools
- [ ] 1.4: Create role management endpoints

### Phase 2: Security Hardening
- [ ] 2.1: Implement secure configuration validation
- [ ] 2.2: Add input sanitization and validation
- [ ] 2.3: Enhance error handling to prevent information leakage
- [ ] 2.4: Add security headers and CSRF protection
- [ ] 2.5: Implement rate limiting per user/role

### Phase 3: Enhanced Authentication
- [ ] 3.1: Add session management for web clients
- [ ] 3.2: Implement token refresh mechanisms
- [ ] 3.3: Add audit logging for authentication events
- [ ] 3.4: Create authentication health monitoring

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 85% Complete

## Progress Log
### 2025-06-12
- **Task Created**: Identified remaining 15% of security implementation work
- **Current State**: Basic JWT and API key authentication working with Claude compatibility
- **Next Priority**: Begin with RBAC permission system implementation
- **Dependencies**: None - can build on existing auth foundation
