# Product Context: MCP Node-RED SSE Integration Server

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
- **AI Model Limitation**: AI models (like Claude) lack direct access to automation platforms like Node-RED
- **Integration Gap**: No standardized way for AI agents to manage Node-RED flows and monitor their execution
- **Real-time Visibility**: Existing Node-RED integrations lack real-time monitoring capabilities for AI systems
- **Protocol Mismatch**: Node-RED's REST API doesn't align with emerging AI interaction protocols like MCP

### The Solution
Create a bridge server that:
1. **Translates** between MCP protocol and Node-RED Admin API
2. **Provides** real-time streaming of Node-RED events via Server-Sent Events
3. **Enables** AI agents to fully manage Node-RED automation workflows
4. **Ensures** secure, production-ready integration with proper authentication

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey (AI Agent Perspective)
1. **Discovery**: Agent discovers available Node-RED capabilities via MCP tools
2. **Flow Management**: Agent creates, modifies, or deploys Node-RED flows as needed
3. **Monitoring**: Agent receives real-time updates on flow execution and status
4. **Troubleshooting**: Agent can inspect errors, restart flows, or modify configurations
5. **Optimization**: Agent can analyze flow performance and suggest improvements

### Primary Use Cases

#### 1. AI-Driven Automation Management
- **Scenario**: Claude helps user set up home automation flows
- **Flow**: Claude → MCP Server → Node-RED → IoT Devices
- **Value**: Conversational interface for complex automation setup

#### 2. Real-time Monitoring & Alerting
- **Scenario**: AI monitors critical business flows and alerts on issues
- **Flow**: Node-RED Events → SSE → AI Agent → User Notification
- **Value**: Proactive monitoring with intelligent analysis

#### 3. Dynamic Flow Adaptation
- **Scenario**: AI modifies flows based on changing conditions or user needs
- **Flow**: AI Analysis → Flow Updates → Real-time Deployment
- **Value**: Self-adapting automation systems

#### 4. Troubleshooting Assistant
- **Scenario**: AI helps diagnose and fix Node-RED flow issues
- **Flow**: Error Detection → Flow Analysis → Suggested Fixes → Deployment
- **Value**: Expert-level troubleshooting assistance
