- ðŸ”„ **SSE System**: Real-time event streaming (partial implementation)
- ðŸ”„ **Security**: Authentication layer (enhanced for Claude compatibility)

## Current Implementation Status

### What's Working
- **MCP Server Core**: Full stdio transport with tool registration
- **Node-RED API Client**: Complete CRUD operations for flows and nodes
- **Basic Authentication**: API key and JWT foundation
- **Express Server**: HTTP transport and middleware setup
- **Development Environment**: Full TypeScript build chain, testing, linting

### What's In Progress
- **SSE Handler**: Real-time event streaming infrastructure
- **Event Management**: Node-RED event capture and forwarding
- **Security Hardening**: Complete authentication flow
- **Error Recovery**: Robust connection management and retry logic

### What's Planned
- **Production Features**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, health checks
- **Docker Support**: Complete containerization with multi-stage builds
- **Documentation**: API documentation, deployment guides, usage examples
- **Testing**: Integration tests and performance validation

## Active Technical Decisions

### Current Architecture Choices
1. **Dual Transport**: Supporting both stdio and HTTP transports simultaneously
2. **Service Layer**: Clean separation between MCP protocol and business logic
3. **Event-Driven SSE**: Real-time streaming using Server-Sent Events
4. **TypeScript First**: Full type safety throughout the application

### Immediate Considerations
1. **SSE Connection Management**: How to handle connection limits and cleanup
2. **Event Filtering**: Allowing clients to subscribe to specific event types
3. **Authentication Strategy**: Choosing between JWT vs API key as primary method
4. **Error Handling**: Standardizing error responses across all layers

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority (Next 1-2 days)
1. **Complete SSE Implementation**
   - Finish SSE connection management
   - Implement event filtering and subscriptions
   - Add connection health monitoring

2. **Security Layer Completion**
   - Finalize authentication middleware
   - Add authorization for different operations
   - Implement secure configuration handling

### Medium Priority (Next week)
3. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Standardize error responses
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Improve connection recovery mechanisms

4. **Production Features**
   - Enhanced logging with request correlation
   - Health check endpoints with detailed status
   - Performance monitoring and metrics

### Lower Priority (Future)
5. **Documentation & Testing**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Integration test suite
   - Performance benchmarking

6. **Advanced Features**
   - Multi-instance support with Redis
   - Advanced authentication methods
   - Enhanced monitoring and alerting

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **SSE State Management**: Ensuring clean connection lifecycle management
2. **Event Filtering**: Efficiently filtering Node-RED events for relevant clients
3. **Authentication Integration**: Seamlessly integrating auth across stdio and HTTP transports
4. **Error Boundaries**: Preventing errors in one component from affecting others

### Design Decisions Pending
1. **Event Schema**: Finalizing the structure for Node-RED events
2. **Configuration Strategy**: Environment variables vs config files vs runtime config
3. **Logging Strategy**: Structured logging format and log levels
4. **Deployment Model**: Docker-first vs traditional deployment

## Active Dependencies

### Critical External Dependencies
- **Node-RED Instance**: Requires accessible Node-RED Admin API
- **MCP SDK**: Dependent on @modelcontextprotocol/sdk stability
- **TypeScript Ecosystem**: tsx for development, Jest for testing

### Current Environment Requirements
- **Node.js 18+**: For ES modules and modern features
- **Network Access**: HTTP connectivity to Node-RED instance
- **File System**: Write access for logs and temporary files

## Development Workflow Status

### Current Development Setup
- **Hot Reload**: Working with tsx for rapid development
- **Testing**: Jest configured but test coverage incomplete
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier configured and enforcing standards
- **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation to dist/ directory

### Active Tools & Scripts
```bash
npm run dev      # Development with hot reload
npm run build    # Production build
npm run test     # Test suite execution
npm run lint     # Code quality checks
```

## Recent Learning & Insights

### Key Discoveries
1. **MCP Protocol Nuances**: stdio transport requires careful stdout management
2. **Node-RED API Behavior**: Some operations require specific timing and sequencing
3. **SSE Best Practices**: Connection management more complex than initially planned
4. **TypeScript Module System**: ES modules require .js extensions in imports

### Architectural Insights
1. **Service Layer Benefits**: Clean separation enables easier testing and maintenance
2. **Event-Driven Design**: Natural fit for real-time monitoring requirements
3. **Type Safety Value**: TypeScript catching numerous potential runtime errors
4. **Configuration Complexity**: Multiple deployment scenarios require flexible config

This active context represents the current state of development and should be updated as work progresses and priorities shift.
