  title: MCP Node-RED Server API
  description: |
    A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Node-RED integration.

    This API provides enterprise-grade Node-RED integration with modern security,
    observability, and performance features built for 2025 standards.

    ## Features

    - 🚀 **MCP Integration**: Full Model Context Protocol support
    - 🔒 **Enterprise Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, CORS
    - 📊 **Observability**: Health checks, metrics, distributed tracing
    - 🔄 **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events for live updates
    - 🐳 **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-ready with comprehensive health checks

    ## Authentication

    This API supports multiple authentication methods:

    - **JWT Bearer Token**: For programmatic access
    - **API Key**: For service-to-service communication
    - **No Auth**: For health checks and public endpoints

    ## Rate Limiting

    - **Window**: 15 minutes (configurable)
    - **Max Requests**: 100 per window (configurable)
    - **Headers**: `X-RateLimit-*` headers in responses
